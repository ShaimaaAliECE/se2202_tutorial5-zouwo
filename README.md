# Tutorial5: DOM objects and Events
In this tutorial, you'll practice working with JS DOM objects and events while creating a tic-tac-toe game.
The starter code of this tutorial has two files; one of them is an HTML document linked to the other file, which is a JavaScript file. Please keep the HTML file as it is and follow the instructions in the comments of the JS file to complete the game.

# Not auto-graded tests this time
Please don't expect to see results from an autograded test as there'llbe none this time, instead, we'd look at the behavior of the page after your commit your updates and publish it. 

# Use GitHub Pages to publish the site.
After you commit and push your changes, 
1. Go to the settings of your tutorial5 repository
2. Click on 'Pages' in the side panel.
3. Choose 'main' as the source branch.
4. Then click 'Save'.
5. Give it few moments until it updates and test the URL to make sure it's working as expected.

# You don't need to submit anything to OWL, just make sure the final URL is working on the GitHub classroom repo
